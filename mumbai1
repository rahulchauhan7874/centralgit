			<h2>Some Known fact about the earth</h2>
			
			<img src="earth.jpg" width="300" height="300">
			
			<p>Earth is not a perfect sphere. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(opens in new tab), as Earth spins, gravity points toward the center of our planet (assuming for explanation's sake that Earth is a perfect sphere), and a centrifugal force pushes outward. But since this gravity-opposing force acts perpendicular to the axis of Earth, and Earth's axis is tilted, centrifugal force at the equator is not exactly opposed to gravity. </p>
